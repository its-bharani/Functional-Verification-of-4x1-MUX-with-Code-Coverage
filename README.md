# Functional-Verification-of-4x1-MUX-with-Code-Coverage

## **Introduction**

This project involves the design and verification of a 4x1 multiplexer (MUX) using Verilog for the RTL implementation and SystemVerilog for the verification environment. A complete testbench is developed to validate the multiplexer functionality, leveraging components such as drivers, monitors, scoreboards, and reference models.
Additionally, code coverage analysis has been performed using QuestaSim to ensure thorough testing of the design.
